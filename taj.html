            Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the south bank of the Yamuna river in the Indian city of
            Agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658), to house
            the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal <br> <br>The Taj Mahal is considered to be the greatest
            architectural
            achievement in the whole range of Indo-Islamic architecture. Its recognised architectonic beauty has a
            rhythmic combination of solids and voids, concave and convex and light shadow; such as arches and domes
            further increases the aesthetic aspect.
